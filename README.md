# GeoQuiz
## _First Android project_

This is my first Android project using only Kotlin and Android SDK. This project was done following this book: [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (4th Edition)](https://bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide-5th-edition/)

Cheating button cause to open Cheating Activity where user can peep the answer for current question.

This app created only for education purposes. The main topics were: activities, layouts, explicit intents, mvc and general android SDK skills.
