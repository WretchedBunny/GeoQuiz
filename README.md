# GeoQuiz
## _First Android project_

This is my first Android project using only Kotlin and Android SDK. This project was done following this book: [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (4th Edition)](https://bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide-5th-edition/)
These book contains code for every app and challenges, task for every chapter for the particular app for reader to implement extra functionality. There are no keys for them, so reader should implement them by hands.

## Description

This app is some sort of "quiz" where you have 6 questions to which you must answer. There are two activities: one main where you have 3 buttons for answering true or false and other is for cheating. Cheating button cause to open Cheating Activity where user can peep the answer for current question.

This app created only for education purposes. The main topics were: activities, layouts, explicit intents, mvc and general android SDK skills.
